## opencv (cv2)

First, I suggest:

```
conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg 
```

Do:

```
conda install -c conda-forge/label/cf202003 opencv 
```

Or generally:

```
conda install -c conda-forge opencv 
```

#Python

### numpy

```
conda install -c anaconda numpy 
```

### yaml

To import in python3:

```
conda install -c conda-forge yaml
```

To import in python2:

```
conda install pyyaml
```

#ROS

###rospy

It didn't work for me, their site says though:

```
 conda install -c conda-forge ros-rospy 
```
