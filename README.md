This repo is created to log some learning skills in computer, web, and programming area. The main goal, is to save data when solving an issue, learning how to do a task, or ... , so that there is no need to the the same search, next time facing the same problem.

I put my Linux terminal history here, in the *history* folder.

Also, as I face an error or technical question and search for it, I log the result the *issues* folder, so I can come and check it the next time I faced a similar issue.

The *instructions* folder includes all my logged command-line (or maybe gui) instructions to install programs or do other stuff. Some instruction scripts are such unified that can be considered as a brief tutorial; Like the one I wrote for git skills.
