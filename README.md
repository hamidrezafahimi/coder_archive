# Test Repo

This repo is created to log some learnings skills in computer, web, and programming area. 
I put my Linux terminal history here, in the *history* folder. 
Also, as I face an error or question and search for it, I log the result the *issues* folder, so I can come and check it the next time I faced a similar issue.
