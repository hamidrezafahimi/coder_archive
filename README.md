# InsUtiPles: Instructions, Utils, Samples

This is the result of my *don't-throw-little-stuff-away* routine. A set of go-to programs archived together. The repo contains two types of programs:

* Samples of whatever. All of my mini-projects that are not worth it to be separated repositories. Starting a new project, I follow some tutorials and make primary samples before entering the main job. I put all of them here. 

* Utils for whatever. Sometimes I find it necessary to create simple programs (e.g. reading or writing some special filetypes, plotting specia shapes, dealing with special libraries, etc.) which are pretty simple while taking time to do them again. So, I can store them all in this little box.

* Instructions to do whatever.
