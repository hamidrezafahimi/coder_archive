# Test Repo

This repo is created to log some learnings skills in computer, web, and programming area.

I put my Linux terminal history here, in the *history* folder.

Also, as I face an error or question and search for it, I log the result the *issues* folder, so I can come and check it the next time I faced a similar issue.

The *instructions* folder includes all my logged command-line (or maybe gui) instructions to install programs or do other stuff.

To be honest, initially, I created this repo to learn and test how to work with git branchs. I didn't want to mess my main repositories.
